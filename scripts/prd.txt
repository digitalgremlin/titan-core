# Overview

Garden Gate Publishing is launching its first beginner gardening book, "Quickstart Guide to Raised Bed & Container Gardening for Beginners." To support the soft launch, a focused web presence is needed, comprising a single-page website and a dedicated book landing page. These digital properties primarily convert book readers into newsletter subscribers by offering access to exclusive bonus content ("Beginner Gardener's Toolkit") and providing continued engagement through a monthly newsletter.

# Core Features

* **Single-Page Promotional Website:**

  * Provides visitors with a compelling overview of the book, author credibility, testimonials, and future content teasers.
  * Encourages newsletter sign-up through clearly defined calls-to-action and immediate access to valuable gardening resources.
  * Utilizes responsive and performance-optimized Astro JS components for seamless user experience.

* **Dedicated Book Landing Page:**

  * Focuses exclusively on converting readers through an email signup to access bonus content.
  * Clearly outlines toolkit contents and author expertise to reinforce trust and maximize conversions.
  * Integration with an email marketing provider for immediate content delivery upon signup.

* **CMS Integration (Prismic recommended):**

  * Centralized management of content to streamline updates and scalability.
  * Flexible content schema supporting book details, newsletter descriptions, toolkit content, testimonials, and future blog posts.

# User Experience

## User Personas:

* **Beginner Gardener:** Enthusiastic but inexperienced, seeking clear, accessible guidance and immediate actionable resources.

## Key User Flows:

* Visitor arrives at the site via the book or social media → Engages with compelling content → Signs up via email → Immediately receives toolkit → Continues engagement through monthly newsletters.

## UI/UX Considerations:

* Clear, friendly, beginner-oriented messaging.
* Simple, intuitive navigation, optimized for desktop and mobile responsiveness.
* Minimal friction in email signup forms (limited fields, clear privacy assurances).

* **Hosting Infrastructure:** Netlify or Vercel for static hosting

## Data Models:

* **CMS Content Types:** Homepage, Landing Page, Toolkit resources, Blog Posts, Testimonials, Author bio

## APIs and Integrations:

* **Prismic REST/GraphQL APIs:** Content retrieval at build time
* **Email Marketing API:** User email submissions and automation triggers

## Infrastructure Requirements:

* Hosting static site via CDN for optimal performance
* Automated build/deployment pipeline triggered by CMS content updates

# Development Roadmap

## MVP Requirements:

* Astro JS project setup with essential components (Hero, Intro, Author Bio, Testimonials, Toolkit Sign-up, Footer)
* CMS setup (Prismic) with basic content schemas
* Landing page setup with clear CTA and signup integration
* Email delivery integration and automated toolkit distribution
* Basic responsive design implementation

## Future Enhancements:

# Logical Dependency Chain

1. Project setup: Astro JS, Git, and CMS integration.
2. Define and implement CMS content schemas.
3. Develop foundational UI components (Hero, Footer).
4. Integrate CMS content into front-end.
5. Develop and integrate email signup form functionality.
6. Build automated email delivery workflows.
7. Test end-to-end user flows for signup and content delivery.
8. Deploy MVP to production.
9. Iteratively add enhancements (e.g., blog functionality, additional content types).

# Risks and Mitigations

* **Technical Integration Complexity:**

  * Risk: Difficulty integrating Astro JS with CMS and email platforms.
  * Mitigation: Early prototyping of API connections, leveraging documented integration guides and existing Astro plugins.

* **Scope Creep:**

  * Risk: Excessive initial features delaying launch.
  * Mitigation: Strict adherence to defined MVP requirements; clearly separate enhancements into future phases.

* **Resource Constraints:**

  * Risk: Limited developer time or technical resources.
  * Mitigation: Employing AI-driven tools (Cursor IDE, MCP Task Manager) to automate and streamline repetitive coding and project management tasks.
